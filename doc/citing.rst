Citing RK-Opt
=============

Are you using RK-Opt in research work to be published?  If so, please include
explicit mention of our work in your publication.  We suggest language such as this:

    "To solve problem (17), we used RK-Opt, a package for optimization of Runge-Kutta
    methods [1],[2]"

with the following entry in your bibliography:

    [1] **RK-Opt: Software for the design of Runge-Kutta methods**, version 0.2.
    DI Ketcheson, M Parsani, and AJ Ahmadia.

as well as one or more of those below.  Specifically,
if you use the **RK-coeff-opt** package to optimize SSP coefficients, please reference [2].
If you use the **RK-coeff-opt** package to develop low-storage methods, please reference [3].
If you use the **RK-coeff-opt** package to optimize for accuracy, and/or enforce a given
stability function, please reference [4].
If you use the **RK-coeff-opt** package to develop general linear methods, please reference [7].
If you use the **polyopt** package, please reference [5].
If you use the **am_rad-opt** package, please reference [6].

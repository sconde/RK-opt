Given a spectrum (typically corresponding to a spatial
semi-discretization of a PDE), finds an optimal stability polynomial. The
polynomial coefficients can then be used as input to RK-coeff-opt to find a
corresponding Runge-Kutta method.

This is the implementation of the algorithm described in [ketcheson-ahmadia]_.
The code was written by Aron Ahmadia and David Ketcheson.

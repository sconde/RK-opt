Find stability functions with optimal radius of absolute monotonicity.
This includes codes for optimizing stability functions of 
multistep, multistage methods and even methods with downwinding.

Generally, the optimization problem is phrased as a sequence of linear 
programming feasibility problems.  For details, see [ketcheson2009]_.

The optimization of rational functions is experimental.
